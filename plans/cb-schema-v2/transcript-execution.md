# Transcript - cb-schema-v2: decision and execution (D1-D6, plans 0-4)

**Date:** 2026-06-10
**Surfaces:** a single composable-beliefs TUI thread (Fable 5), picking up the
design record the previous session wrote, carrying the D1 naming debate to a
decision, and executing the full plan series in the same thread.
**Companion to:** [`design.md`](design.md) (the decided design record, with its
execution amendments inline), the plan files `plan-0.md` through `plan-4.md`
(each carrying its execution record), and [`why-inference.md`](why-inference.md)
(the README source material the debate produced).

## Summary

One session took cb-schema-v2 from "design awaiting decisions" to shipped: D1-D6
resolved (D1 `inference`, decided through a full adversarial debate the user
requested after overriding the immutable-history consideration), plans 0-4 cut
and executed end to end - canon beliefs through the write flow, the four-type
code and migration tool, the framework contract supersessions, all eight
collections migrated with the adjudicated splits, and the README rewritten with
the naming debate's explanatory prose as its new centerpiece section.

Commits: composable-beliefs `364233f` (the whole landing, 79 files),
belief-collections `16e2fe8` (the six collection migrations); both pushed.
261 tests green at the end; every framework-graph write through the write flow;
all eight collections verify under v2 with sdl reproducing exactly its two
teaching method-check failures.

## 1. Review: "examine the repo and plans/cb-schema-v2/design.md"

The design doc's factual claims were verified against the live repo and graph:
the migration inventory matched `bs stats` exactly (114/27/5/82), the sdl worked
migration matched the collection node for node, the code touch points resolved
to real functions (the verdict selector turned out to be one line in
`CB.Eval.Predicates`). One real gap surfaced: **cb:c029 was missing from the
supersession list** - its invariant "retired status is exclusive to
contract-grade implications" changes on both words under v2, and the machinery
table had the direction backwards (the v2 change is a widening, contract-grade
to any directive). Also flagged: subject containment passes vacuously on the
subject-sparse cb: graph, so its compound triage is pure judgment - the doc
should say so. Both folded into design.md.

## 2. "ok decide as you see fit, do d1-d6 need to be decided before beginning dev?"

Decisions made and recorded in design.md: D1 `inference` (over retaining
`implication`), D2 hybrid migration, D3 trim, D4 grounding rule confirmed, D5
keep `primitive`, D6 conventions re-type. Gating answer: only D1/D2/D4 gate
code; D3/D5/D6 gate graph content, but plan-0 leads the series so the plan cut
wanted all six. One flag raised to the user: the session memory recorded an
earlier lean toward keeping `implication`, and the decision overrode it -
offered for veto.

## 3. "i am overriding the immutable history consideration... present the case for both sides"

Launch reframed the debate: not "what does the existing graph say" but "what
word do we live with." Both cases presented in full. For `implication`:
ordinary-English fit ("the implications of these findings" is colloquially
ampliative), the relational grammar (an implication is *of* something - the
name wears its grounding), the ML-serving collision avoided (`inference` is
saturated vocabulary in the agent ecosystem). For `inference`: technical
accuracy at the exact point the design cares about (the type's defining licence
is to exceed its deps; entailment is precisely the licence it lacks; CB performs
no deduction), the one-line glossary test (a definition of "implication" that
grants the scope-widening licence fights its own noun), the lifecycle argument
(the machinery supersedes a falsified conclusion while its deps stand - the
signature of inference, paradoxical under "implication"), and the
near-disqualifying in-framework collision (the contract kind `implies` is
directive-only in v2; naming the descriptive type `implication` puts one lexeme
on both sides of the very boundary v2 draws). Verdict held at roughly 60/40 for
`inference`, with `conclusion` named as the strongest third option if the
ML-collision worry dominated.

## 4. "51% sold on inference but curious about conclusion" / "inference belief or inferred belief?"

`conclusion` evaluated seriously: it wins on result-noun purity, zero ML
collision, and lay accessibility, and its verb pairs as cleanly
(attest/aggregate/conclude/prescribe). It loses on the finality connotation
pointing the wrong way twice (the graph's riskiest type sounding most settled;
mid-graph nodes sounding terminal), the prescriptive-mood leak ("the committee
concluded we should divest" is idiomatic), no theory lineage (defeasible
inference, nonmonotonic inference, belief revision - CB with
supersession-on-falsification IS defeasible-inference machinery), the glossary
direction (name the type with the technical word, define it with the lay one),
and the compound/conclusion visual collision. Net: between `implication` and
`inference`, closer to `inference`; 60/40 held.

Grammar ruling: the house pattern is the bare noun ("an inference", like "a
compound"); attributive form "inference belief" (type-as-classifier);
"inferred belief" describes provenance rather than naming the type slot and
starts a participle pattern the other types refuse.

## 5. The deduction questions

Three questions that became why-inference.md and then the README section:

- *Why isn't the inference node a result of deduction?* Because the move is
  ampliative: from "case 7 dropped a record" (twice) to "this snapshot drops
  records from bulk writes over ten items" - the conclusion is about all bulk
  writes, the premises about one case. The gap is the problem of induction,
  unbridgeable by deduction; and the falsification lifecycle requires the gap,
  since a clean future run kills the generalization while the observations
  stand.
- *Why CAN'T an implication exceed its premises?* By definition: "an entailment
  of the premises that is not an entailment of the premises" has the shape of
  "a bachelor's wife."
- *Doesn't "fails only with a premise" imply deduction?* Yes - that is the
  modus tollens: CB's machinery is built for these nodes to fail independently
  of their deps, therefore they are not implications of their deps.

Kicker that landed: **the compound is the one deduction CB stores**
(conjunction introduction; subject containment as its formal shadow; the
epistemic work is the selection). The user's follow-up - "so compound IS
implication by another name?" - confirmed it precisely: the compound is the
only node type whose claim genuinely is entailed by its deps; "implication" was
technically accurate for compound and nothing else in the schema.

## 6. "ready to go with inference and proceed" + the README directive

The user directed: include the why-inference writeup semi-verbatim in the
README - the positive case, no contest framing, "how the edges define the
territory" - and extend that explanatory register through the README generally.
Also (earlier in the same turn): philosophy's vocabulary for expressing and
navigating ambiguity may be an increasingly valuable engineering skill; this
design cycle consumed direction of fit, the deductive/ampliative boundary,
defeasibility, and speech-act mood, and turned each into a check or a type.

Execution followed in the same thread:

- **Persisted the debate** as why-inference.md; cut plan-0 through plan-4.
- **Plan-0.** Seven canon primitives (a470-a476) through preflight + import;
  the preflight surfaced the dag-schema overlap family (reviewed per c032,
  recorded in evidence, a467/c040 precedent) and **exposed two supersession
  targets the design list had missed: c026 and c027** - added to design.md and
  plan-2. Contract drafting deferred to plan-2 (successors are v2-typed).
- **Plan-1.** Four-type enum; verifier checks (kind-type table by role
  discovery, subject containment with vacuous pass and unresolvable-dep skip,
  grounding, retired-is-directive); machinery re-attached; loader gate;
  `mix cb.migrate.v2` with full-override `--resolutions`. First dry run on cb:
  forced the **`document:` stipulation amendment**: D6's own confirmed
  re-homes (method:a1-a5, the lib: rules) are document-grounded, so the
  design's plan/user/session list was incomplete against its own intent.
  cb: migrated (76 re-typed; a131/a138/a173 to inference by resolution;
  a387/a438 mechanically via the prescriptive-kind-on-compound rule; **a304
  grounding backfilled** via cb.import - artifact and evidence were both
  empty, the one legitimate backfill shape). codepath: 5 contract re-types.
  Test fixtures updated; 261 green except the sdl integration test, which
  pulled plan-3 forward.
- **Plan-2.** c026-c038 superseded to c051-c056 via cb.adjudicate; c057
  (kind-type table, 38 rows), c058 (containment), c059 (grounding) imported;
  CLAUDE.md render beliefs a445/a446/a447/a452/a468/a469 superseded by
  a477-a482 - including moving "concludes what none of its inputs states
  alone" from the compound to the inference per D3 - and **c048 superseded by
  c060** because render_sections cite belief ids (the regenerated CLAUDE.md
  was silently rendering the old text until the render contract followed).
  Representational dep re-points (a387, c047, c049) cleared `bs stale`.
- **Plan-3.** sdl split per the design's worked table (a006 to a008+a009, a3
  trimmed to a010, a007 re-pointed); toy:a9 to a10+a11; method's 14 mechanical
  re-types plus **method:c10** (verdict binds to inference only - c2's prose
  strain became a check) and the consequent **c2 to c11 enum supersession**
  (c10's own kind needed admitting); agent-behavior's seven triage nodes
  adjudicated (a072 and a123 to inference - a123 the one genuine containment
  escape, a "works because" abduction; six mood re-homes a396-a401, with
  a359's stipulation untangled from its external source); paradigm's three
  syntheses to inference; lib mechanical. All eight collections verified; sdl's
  two teaching FAILs reproduced against a008.
- **Plan-4.** README: the new "Why 'inference' - the edges define the
  territory" section under a rewritten four-types section; every transcript
  regenerated from the live graphs; the sdl worked example now walks all four
  types and reads the split as history; the reference table carries c051-c060.
  Quickstart re-targeted (its compound exemplar a138 is now the inference
  exemplar - "notice the word doing the work: because"); the five skills and
  the design-reference docs updated. Migration recorded as cb:a483.

## 7. "commit" / "push"

`364233f` (composable-beliefs) and `16e2fe8` (belief-collections), both pushed
to main. All gates green on exactly the committed trees.

## Deviations from the design, complete list

1. c026 and c027 added to the supersession list (found by plan-0 preflight).
2. c029 added to the supersession list (found in the pre-decision review).
3. `document:` admitted as a stipulation scheme (forced by D6's own examples).
4. c048 superseded by c060 (render_sections are id-bearing; the design's
   "CLAUDE.md render-section beliefs" list implied but did not name it).
5. method:c2 kept as the kind enum with a new c10 carrying the type bindings,
   then c2 superseded by c11 anyway to admit `derivation-table` - the design
   left "supersede c2 vs new c10" to plan time; the answer was both, for
   different reasons.
6. The grounding rule re-homed ~30 cb: primitives (prescriptive kinds with
   stipulation artifacts), more than the design's "82 primitives unchanged"
   anticipated - the kind-type table forces it.
7. a304 grounding backfill (empty artifact and evidence; plan:cb-schema-v2 as
   the reaffirmation stipulation, reasoning in the evidence entry).
