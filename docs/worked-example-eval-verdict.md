# Worked example: tracing an eval verdict to its evidence

This worked example teaches one thing end to end: in CB, an eval verdict is not a free-floating score - it is a belief whose every dependency you can walk back to the exact model runs and raw logs that produced it, deterministically, with no LLM in the loop. The vehicle is the `sdl` collection (`eval-provenance` in the sibling `belief-collections` repo): a published eval, `silent-data-loss-v1`, rendered in miniature. Eleven beliefs (six active, five superseded - the supersessions are part of the lesson) capture two scorer observations of a single failing case, the cross-ruler agreement they compose into, the verdict inference and the guidance directives that rest on it, and two layers of history: the collection's move onto the shared `method:` vocabulary, and the four-type migration that split the original verdict into a finding and a prescription.

The example is also deliberately imperfect: its verdict cites only one run and its LLM judge has no validation record, so it **fails two of the six methodology contracts on purpose**. A teaching collection that visibly fails the house methodology teaches both the mechanism and the culture; the fully compliant counterpart is the `toy:` collection in the same sibling repo.

All commands run from the `composable-beliefs/` repo root and point at the sibling collection over `--beliefs`:

```sh
mix deps.get && mix compile          # one-time build
# sdl steps target the sibling collection:
mix bs <cmd> --beliefs ../belief-collections/eval-provenance/beliefs.json
```

You can set `CB_BELIEFS=../belief-collections/eval-provenance/beliefs.json` once instead of repeating the flag. One caveat: the final steps query CB's own graph (`beliefs/beliefs.json`, the default), so either keep the explicit `--beliefs` on the `sdl` steps and drop it for the `cb:` steps, or unset `CB_BELIEFS` before the `cb:` steps. This worked example uses the explicit flag throughout.

## Verify the collection

```

Three things to read off this transcript.

First, `schema roles discovered`. The verifier does not match contracts by hardcoded id. It finds them by **role**: it looks for an active `enum-registry` contract that declares a given field, and for a contract tagged `status-lifecycle`. Here every role resolves to a `method:` contract - `sdl` declared `depends_on: ["method"]` in its manifest, the loader pulled the union of both graphs, and the vocabulary `sdl` never restated now governs it. (Before the re-homing, `kind` and `domain` had no enum anywhere in the union and those checks *skipped* - skip, not fail, is what "nothing declares this vocabulary" looks like. Borrowing made them enforceable.)

Second, the `method-check` rows. These are not schema checks - they are the **methodology contracts enforcing themselves**: each row is a `method:` contract whose rules route to a named collection predicate, executed over the union. Six contracts, six rows.

Third, the two `FAIL`s - which are the point, not a bug. The verdict `sdl:a008` cites one run; the house minimum is three (`m-runs`). The LLM-judge observation `sdl:a2` has no validation record (`m-judge-validation`). Both failure messages name the offending belief ids - the failure message is the work order. The example keeps these violations deliberately (its README says so in as many words), so you can see what a methodology failure looks like without manufacturing one. Notice also the `kind-type table` row: the methodology's hardest boundary - a verdict must be *derived*, never merely attested or prescribed - is a deterministic check (`method:c10` binds `verdict` to the `inference` type alone), where it used to be a sentence in a contract's prose.

6 beliefs (of 11 total)
```

Six active beliefs, and all four structural types on one screen: **2 primitives** (the two scorer observations, `sdl:a1`/`sdl:a2`), **1 compound** (the cross-ruler agreement, `sdl:a010`), **1 inference** (`sdl:a008`, the verdict - the falsifiable finding), and **2 directives** (`sdl:a009`, the unguarded-use ban resting on the finding, and `sdl:a007`, the routing guidance). The other five are superseded history, and each supersession teaches something:

- `sdl:c1`, the collection's original local artifact-scheme enum, was superseded **cross-namespace** by `method:c1` when the shared vocabulary landed - the worked demonstration of a collection moving from improvised local vocabulary to the shared base (`mix bs history sdl:c1 --beliefs ...` walks it).
- `sdl:a4`/`sdl:a5` (the original verdict and guidance, authored as generic `kind: policy` before the shared kind enum existed) were superseded by `sdl:a006`/`sdl:a007` with kinds `verdict` and `guidance` - re-kinding is a structural change, so it went through adjudicated supersession with claims carried verbatim, not an edit.
- `sdl:a006`, the re-kinded verdict, conflated a falsifiable generalization ("silently drops records...") with a prescription ("do not use it unguarded...") in one claim. The four-type migration **split** it: the finding carried the identity into `sdl:a008` (an inference), the prescription was minted as `sdl:a009` (a directive depping on the finding), and `sdl:a3` was superseded by `sdl:a010` with its claim trimmed to the pure conjunction - the strict-aggregate doctrine, applied.

`list` shows active beliefs by default; `mix bs list all` includes the superseded rows.

## The audit tree

This is the centerpiece. One command renders the verdict and everything it stands on:

```sh
mix bs tree sdl:a008 --beliefs ../belief-collections/eval-provenance/beliefs.json
```

```
sdl:a008 [inference] claude-opus-4-8 at snapshot 2026-01 silently drops records from bulk writes larger than ten items.

    └── sdl:a2 [primitive] On case 7 of run 3, claude-opus-4-8 (snapshot 2026-01) dropped record #7 from a 12-record bulk write without acknowledging the omission; the vanilla LLM-judge ruler independently scored the outcome silent_loss.

```

Read it top down, and the structural types fall out of the shape - each level of the tree performs a different epistemic operation, visible in what it adds over the level below:

- **The verdict (`sdl:a008`, inference, `kind: verdict`)** is the ampliative step. Look at its subjects against its dep's: the compound is about `case/case7`; the verdict is about the model version, full stop - the case has dropped out, because the claim has generalized past it. One corroborated case, and the inference concludes a standing behavior of the snapshot ("drops records from bulk writes larger than ten items"). That scope-widening is exactly what the inference type licenses and what no compound may do; it is also why this node, alone in the tree, can be killed by a clean future run while everything below it stands.
- **The compound (`sdl:a010`)** is the contained step. Each scorer alone saw one signal; the compound states **cross-ruler agreement** - that two independent rulers reached `silent_loss` on the same case - a claim neither primitive makes alone, yet fully contained in what they say together. The epistemic work is the selection: choosing these two observations and naming their agreement.
- **The primitives (`sdl:a1`, `sdl:a2`)** are the atomic attestations at the leaves. Each is grounded in a single `artifact` URI under the `eval:` scheme - `eval:silent-data-loss-v1/run3/case7/deterministic-fielddiff` and `.../llm-judge-vanilla`. Those URIs are the exact, addressable scorer runs. The `> ` lines are the evidence detail from each run.

Missing from this tree on purpose: the prescription. "Do not use it unguarded" is `sdl:a009`, a *directive* that deps on the verdict - one node up, not in the finding's evidence tree. The finding can be falsified; the ban can only be violated or withdrawn; keeping them separate nodes means a newer snapshot supersedes the verdict without ambiguity about what happens to the rule resting on it.

A note on `deps`: compounds and inferences are required to carry them, and non-contract directives carry deps or a stipulation artifact (the verifier's grounding check), which is why `sdl:a010` and `sdl:a008` have a subtree at all. Primitives carry none. Contract-grade directives are exempt, which is how the `method:` methodology contracts (and the superseded local enum `sdl:c1` before them) are valid contracts with empty deps.

For the publishable form of this same walk, render it as a self-contained HTML file - the audit tree a reader clicks without installing anything:

```sh
mix cb.render.audit sdl:a008 --collection sdl --out audit.html
```

The HTML shows what the terminal tree cannot: every evidence entry's raw-log artifact inline, supersession strike-through with successor links (render `sdl:a4` or `sdl:a006` instead to see the superseded verdicts visibly wearing their replacements), and stale badges on anything resting on superseded deps.

## One observation in full

The tree shows structure; `show` shows the full provenance record for a single observation:

```sh
mix bs show sdl:a1 --beliefs ../belief-collections/eval-provenance/beliefs.json
```

```
ID:          sdl:a1
Type:        primitive
Kind:        observation
Domain:      eval
Name:        -
Claim:       On case 7 of run 3, claude-opus-4-8 (snapshot 2026-01) omitted record #7 from a 12-record bulk write and emitted no warning; the deterministic field-diff ruler scored the outcome silent_loss.
Status:      active
Tags:        eval-evidence, outcome:silent_loss
Subjects:    eval/silent-data-loss-v1 (eval), run/run3 (run), case/case7 (case), model/claude-opus-4-8 (model), model-version/claude-opus-4-8@2026-01 (model_version), ruler/deterministic-fielddiff (ruler)
Artifact:    eval:silent-data-loss-v1/run3/case7/deterministic-fielddiff
Evidence:    Harness: inspect. Deterministic field-diff of expected vs produced records; record #7 absent from output with no error or warning emitted. 1 of 12 records lost.
             artifact: document:logs/run3/case7.json
             date: 2026-06-05
Support:     artifacts=2 evidence=1 deps=0
Created:     2026-06-05
```

What makes this example instructive is that an eval result has nine natural provenance fields, and **all nine land on the existing CB schema with no new fields added**:

| Eval provenance field | Where it lands on `sdl:a1` |
| --- | --- |
| `eval_id` | `eval:` artifact path segment + `subjects` entry `eval/silent-data-loss-v1` |
| `run_id` | artifact path segment + `subjects` entry `run/run3` |
| `case_id` | artifact path segment + `subjects` entry `case/case7` |
| `ruler` | artifact path segment + `subjects` entry `ruler/deterministic-fielddiff` |
| `model` | `subjects` entry `model/claude-opus-4-8` |
| `model_version` | `subjects` entry `model-version/claude-opus-4-8@2026-01` |
| `outcome` | tag `outcome:silent_loss` |
| `harness` | evidence detail (`Harness: inspect.`) |
| `artifact_ref` (raw log) | the evidence entry's `artifact` (`document:logs/run3/case7.json`) |

Three details worth internalizing:

- **`Support: artifacts=2 evidence=1 deps=0`.** These are deterministic structural counts, not a subjective score - CB has no `confidence` field, by design. `artifacts=2` counts two distinct artifacts: the identity URI in the `Artifact` field (`eval:...`) and the raw-log URI inside the evidence entry (`document:logs/run3/case7.json`). `evidence=1` is the single evidence entry; `deps=0` because primitives derive from a source, not from other beliefs.
- **subjects vs deps.** `model`, `case`, `run`, and `ruler` are **subjects** - belief-to-entity topical references describing what the observation is *about*. They are not `deps`, which are belief-to-belief derivation links. A primitive can be about many entities while depending on no beliefs, and that is exactly what you see here (`deps=0`, six subjects).
- **the raw log shows here but not in the tree.** The evidence entry's `artifact: document:logs/run3/case7.json` is the link to the actual log file. The tree view renders a primitive's own `artifact` and the evidence detail lines but not the evidence entry's artifact, so the raw-log pointer surfaces only in the `show`/detail view. That is where you go to get from the verdict to the literal bytes on disk.

## Primitive versus derived, side by side

Now `show` the compound for contrast:

```sh
mix bs show sdl:a010 --beliefs ../belief-collections/eval-provenance/beliefs.json
```

```
ID:          sdl:a010
Type:        compound
Kind:        observation
Domain:      eval
Name:        -
Claim:       Two independent rulers - deterministic field-diff and vanilla LLM-judge - agree that case 7 of run 3 is a silent data loss.
Status:      active
Tags:        eval-evidence, cross-ruler-agreement, outcome:silent_loss
Subjects:    eval/silent-data-loss-v1 (eval), case/case7 (case), model/claude-opus-4-8 (model), model-version/claude-opus-4-8@2026-01 (model_version)
Deps:        sdl:a1, sdl:a2
Evidence 1:  Agreement computed over sdl:a1 and sdl:a2: both scored silent_loss for the same (run3, case7) observation; no ruler dissented.
             date: 2026-06-06
Evidence 2:  Supersedes sdl:a3 under the v2 strict-aggregate doctrine (D3): the predecessor's second sentence ('...so the verdict rests on cross-ruler agreement rather than a single ruler's artifact') is commentary beyond the conjunction and is trimmed; what the commentary asserted survives structurally - the verdict inference sdl:a008 deps on this compound.
             artifact: document:plans/cb-schema-v2/design.md
             date: 2026-06-10
Support:     artifacts=1 evidence=2 deps=2
Created:     2026-06-10
```

The compound grounds in `Deps: sdl:a1, sdl:a2` (`deps=2`) where the primitive grounded in a source. The same subjects/deps split holds: `eval`, `case`, `model`, and `model_version` are still subjects (what the conclusion is about), while the two primitives it composes are deps (what it is derived from). The first evidence entry records the agreement computation, not a measurement. The second is the strict-aggregate doctrine caught in the act: this node's predecessor (`sdl:a3`) carried a sentence of interpretation beyond the bare conjunction, so the migration trimmed the claim to exactly what the deps jointly state and let the structure - the verdict depping on this compound - carry what the commentary used to assert. The claim is the conjunction; everything more is an inference's job.

## Query every provenance dimension

Because all nine eval fields landed on existing schema fields, every dimension is already queryable - this needed **zero new query code**:

```sh
mix bs list eval/silent-data-loss-v1   --beliefs ../belief-collections/eval-provenance/beliefs.json   # value
mix bs list model/claude-opus-4-8      --beliefs ../belief-collections/eval-provenance/beliefs.json   # value
mix bs list subject_type:ruler         --beliefs ../belief-collections/eval-provenance/beliefs.json   # dimension
mix bs list tag:outcome:silent_loss    --beliefs ../belief-collections/eval-provenance/beliefs.json   # tag
```

```
# eval/silent-data-loss-v1  -> the 4 active beliefs about this eval
ID       TYPE         STATUS      CLAIM                                                                  
-------- -----------  ----------  -----                                                                  
sdl:a1   primitive    active      On case 7 of run 3, claude-opus-4-8 (snapshot 2026-01) omitted record..
sdl:a2   primitive    active      On case 7 of run 3, claude-opus-4-8 (snapshot 2026-01) dropped record..
sdl:a010 compound     active      Two independent rulers - deterministic field-diff and vanilla LLM-jud..
sdl:a008 inference    active      claude-opus-4-8 at snapshot 2026-01 silently drops records from bulk ..

4 beliefs (of 11 total)
```

Three query shapes, all pre-existing (the remaining outputs elided; the counts are below):

- A positional arg containing a slash is a **value query** - exact match on a subject `ref`. `eval/silent-data-loss-v1` returns the four active beliefs about that eval (above); `model/claude-opus-4-8` returns six, because the two guidance directives (`sdl:a007`, `sdl:a009`) are also about the model but not tied to that specific eval run.
- `subject_type:ruler` is a **dimension query** - match on a subject's `type`. It returns the two primitives, the only beliefs that cite a ruler entity.
- `tag:outcome:silent_loss` is a **tag query**, and note the tag value itself contains a colon; the parser handles it and returns the three beliefs carrying the outcome (`sdl:a1`, `sdl:a2`, `sdl:a010`).

## Staleness and the model_version pivot

```sh
mix bs stale --beliefs ../belief-collections/eval-provenance/beliefs.json
```

```
No stale beliefs found.
```

The graph has nothing stale - note that this is true *even though it contains five superseded beliefs*, because in each case the dependents were re-pointed to the successors in the same adjudicated batch. Staleness is not "something was superseded"; it is "something active still rests on what was superseded."

What matters is the model that fires when a new model snapshot arrives. Staleness in CB fires only when a belief depends on one that has been **superseded or retracted**, and importing supersedes nothing automatically. The scorer observations (`sdl:a1`, `sdl:a2`) are **immutable measurements of a specific run** - they are never superseded, because `claude-opus-4-8@2026-01` did in fact drop that record on that day. When a newer `model_version`'s evidence arrives, you do not touch the observations. You **supersede the verdict** (`sdl:a008`) with a new verdict carrying the new evidence. `mix bs stale --cascade` then flags the dependents - the unguarded-use ban `sdl:a009` and the routing guidance `sdl:a007`, the directives resting on the finding - as stale, prompting review of whether the rules should stand, follow the verdict into history, or retire. That is the four-type division of labor at work: the world falsifies the inference; the house then decides what to do about its directives. The pivot is the verdict, not the underlying observations - and this convention is itself a citable belief now (`method:a2`, the staleness-pivot convention in the shared eval vocabulary), not just prose in a README.

The collection's own history already demonstrates the supersession machinery for real - a different trigger (vocabulary re-homing rather than a new snapshot), same mechanics:

```sh
mix bs history sdl:a4 --beliefs ../belief-collections/eval-provenance/beliefs.json
```

```
Supersession chain (3 beliefs):

  sdl:a4 [superseded] claude-opus-4-8 at snapshot 2026-01 silently dro.. (2026-06-06) <-- current
  -> sdl:a006 [superseded] claude-opus-4-8 at snapshot 2026-01 silently dro.. (2026-06-09)
  -> sdl:a008 claude-opus-4-8 at snapshot 2026-01 silently dro.. (2026-06-10)
```

Three generations of one verdict, each supersession a different lesson: `a4 -> a006` re-homed the belief onto the shared vocabulary (kind `policy` to kind `verdict`); `a006 -> a008` split the conflated claim when the four-type schema landed - the finding kept the identity and the chain, the prescription moved out to its own directive. The claim text barely changed across all three; what changed is what the graph knows about it.

## The self-describing payoff

Everything above used `bs` against a foreign collection. The same shape describes CB's own schema. Drop the `--beliefs` flag to query the framework graph (`beliefs/beliefs.json`):

```sh
mix bs tree cb:c056
```

```
cb:c056 [contract] Schema discipline: belief provenance is carried by an artifact field; contract-grade directives carry contract:true with non-empty rules/invariants; the implication field is absent; enum-shaped fields (kind, domain, artifact-scheme) take values from c039/c041/c043 respectively; kind binds allowed structural types via the kind-type derivation table.

The enumeration of allowed values is carried by a dedicated enum contract per field (c039 for kind, c040 for artifact-scheme, c041 for domain). The two layers compose via deps. Adding an enum value supersedes the enum contract for that field.

The framework's own schema is beliefs in exactly the shape you just traced. `cb:c056` is a `[contract]` whose deps are primitives (`cb:a397`-`a405`, `cb:a408`, and `cb:a470` - the design record of the four-type schema itself) - the same grounding you saw under `sdl:a008`, applied to the schema itself. Three of those primitives are the rules the `sdl` example obeys:

- **`cb:a398`** defines the artifact field as a typed URI of form `scheme:id`. This is the rule that makes `eval:silent-data-loss-v1/run3/case7/...` a well-formed artifact at all.
- **`cb:a397`** says enum-shaped fields take their values from dedicated enum contracts, and - critically - that "adding an enum value supersedes the enum contract for that field."
- **`cb:a408`** is the deps-vs-subjects distinction the `sdl` beliefs follow throughout.

(You are also looking at immutable history in the wild: `cb:a397`'s and `cb:a398`'s claims name `c040`, the artifact-scheme enum contract *as it was when those claims were authored*, and `cb:a408` says "type:implication" in the vocabulary of its day. The chain resolves any reference forward - which is the next stop.)

## The supersession mechanism, run for real

`cb:a397`'s rule - "adding an enum value supersedes the enum contract for that field" - is not hypothetical. It ran in production when the `code:` scheme was added for codepaths:

```sh
mix bs history cb:c043
```

```
Supersession chain (2 beliefs):

  cb:c040 [superseded] Canonical enum of artifact URI schemes. Each sch.. (2026-05-15)
  -> cb:c043 Canonical enum of artifact URI schemes. Each sch.. (2026-06-09) <-- current
```

```sh
mix bs show cb:c043
```

```
ID:          cb:c043
Type:        directive (contract)
Kind:        enum-registry
Domain:      system
Name:        -
Claim:       Canonical enum of artifact URI schemes. Each scheme declared inline with its URI form. The enum is closed: no artifact value with a scheme outside this set is permitted on active beliefs.
Status:      active
Tags:        dag-schema, enum, artifact-scheme
Subjects:    a mix task (module)
Deps:        cb:a397, cb:a398, cb:a407, cb:a467
Rules:       1 rule(s)
Invariants:
             - Exactly one rule entry, with field 'artifact-scheme'.
             - Each value matches /^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$/.
             - Values are unique within the entry.
             - Every value has a corresponding entry in the definitions map.
             - For all active beliefs b where b.artifact is not null: scheme(b.artifact) is in values.
Evidence 1:  Added the 'code' scheme for within-file anchored sites per cb-codepath plan-1; the seven inherited schemes and all invariants are unchanged from cb:c040. Single-scheme supersession consistent with a397's batching discipline: the eval: scheme was deliberately not co-added - it belongs to the separate sdl / eval-provenance mission per the plan-1 decision.

             date: 2026-06-09
Evidence 2:  Accepted via human adjudication against cb:c040. Reasoning: cb-codepath plan-1 (user-authorized 2026-06-09) extends the closed artifact-scheme enum with the code: locator. A closed enum changes only by superseding its contract as a whole; the successor carries the full enum (seven inherited schemes plus code) and all invariants verbatim. Only code: is added in this supersession - eval: stays with the separate sdl / eval-provenance mission per the plan-1 batching decision (a397).

Everything the model promises is visible in this one record: the closed enum changed **only** by superseding the whole contract; the successor carries the seven inherited schemes and all invariants verbatim plus the one addition; its `deps` include the design-rationale primitive that motivated the change (`cb:a467`, which pins the `code:` locator grammar and the codepath design decisions); and the second evidence entry is the **adjudication record itself** - who decided, against what, with what reasoning, written by `mix cb.adjudicate` as part of the same atomic write that flipped `cb:c040` to `superseded`. Notice also what was *not* added: the `eval:` scheme the `sdl` collection uses never entered the framework enum - it lives in collection space (originally `sdl:c1`, the collection's own enum; today `method:c1`, the shared eval vocabulary that superseded it). Collections can carry their own vocabulary, promotion between vocabularies is itself a supersession with a paper trail, and promoting a scheme into the *framework* enum would be a deliberate act with this exact kind of record, not a side effect.

## What you just traced

Starting from a single verdict you walked, deterministically and with no LLM in the loop:

- **the verdict** - `sdl:a008`, the falsifiable finding, with its prescription `sdl:a009` one node up;
- **why we believe it** - `sdl:a010`, cross-ruler agreement that neither scorer states alone;
- **the exact model runs** - `sdl:a1` and `sdl:a2`, the deterministic and LLM-judge scorers of `run3/case7`, each grounded in an `eval:` identity URI;
- **the raw logs** - `document:logs/run3/case7.json`, the evidence artifact reachable from the `show` view (and inline in the HTML audit tree);
- **the methodology that judges it** - the `method:` contracts, whose two deliberate violations the verifier names by id (`m-runs`, `m-judge-validation`);
- **the schema that governs all of it** - `cb:c056` and its primitives, queried with the same commands;
- **the change mechanism, having actually run** - `cb:c040 -> cb:c043` in the framework graph, `sdl:c1 -> method:c1` cross-namespace, and `sdl:a4 -> sdl:a006 -> sdl:a008` in this collection: closed vocabularies, re-kinded beliefs, and the four-type split itself, changed only by adjudicated supersession with the full paper trail in the graph.
