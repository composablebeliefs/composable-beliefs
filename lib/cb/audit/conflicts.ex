defmodule CB.Audit.Conflicts do
  @moduledoc """
  Detect potential conflicts in the DAG. Makes contradictions expensive
  by surfacing them.

  The audit runs three detectors:

  - **Stale overrides** - active nodes whose deps include superseded or
    retracted nodes. Delegates to `CB.Belief.Graph.stale/1`.

  - **Scope overlaps** - pairs of active prescriptions that share scope
    (domain + tags + subjects). Overlap does not imply contradiction;
    it means the nodes are close enough that a contradiction would be
    meaningful. The agent interprets whether a pair actually contradicts,
    is redundant, or is compatible.

  - **Scope classification** - each pair is tagged with the reason for
    overlap (shared tags, shared subject refs, shared subject types, or
    domain-global).

  The design accepts that semantic conflict detection (do two claims
  actually contradict?) requires LLM judgment. This audit surfaces
  candidate pairs; the reviewer decides.

  ## Scope rules

  Two active prescriptions share scope iff:

  1. They are in the same domain (or both have no domain), AND
  2. At least one of:
     - They share a tag
     - They share a subject ref
     - They share a subject type
     - Both have empty tags and subjects (domain-global in same domain)

  Different non-nil domains means no overlap regardless of other fields.

  ## Options

  - `:tag` - only consider nodes with this tag
  - `:domain` - only consider nodes in this domain
  - `:id` - only consider nodes that share scope with this node ID
  - `:contracts_only` - limit to contract-grade prescriptions

  Returns a map with `:stale_overrides`, `:scope_overlaps`, and summary counts.
