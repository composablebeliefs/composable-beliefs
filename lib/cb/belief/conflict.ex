defmodule CB.Belief.Conflict do
  @moduledoc """
  Preflight conflict detection for proposed beliefs.

  Before a belief is written to the DAG, `preflight/1` searches for
  existing nodes that overlap on subject, tag, or claim content, and
  classifies each overlap as supportive, neutral, or conflicting. The
  output feeds an adjudication path - this module performs no writes and
  has no side effects.

  Authoring-time preflight examines all active beliefs so that
  attestations and aggregations can also surface potential contradictions
  before the write lands.

  ## Match axes

  For each active belief in the DAG, three axes of overlap are checked:

  - **Subject overlap** - any shared `subjects[].ref`
  - **Tag overlap** - any shared entry in `tags`
  - **Claim overlap** - same non-nil `domain` plus token intersection in
    `claim`. Tokens are lowercased alphanumerics of length >= 4 with a
    small stopword list stripped; a match requires the intersection to
    cover at least `@claim_overlap_threshold` of the smaller token set

  ## Classification

  - **Conflicting** when the matched belief is contract-grade
    (`CB.Belief.contract?/1` or c-prefix ID) or carries the `dag-schema`
    tag, AND the match carries semantic contact - a shared subject ref
    or claim overlap. Contract-grade matches also receive a
    `priority: :contract_level` marker.
  - **Supportive** when the match shares a subject ref and the matched
    belief is not schema/contract. Subject-level agreement is the
    coarsest "speaks to the same thing" signal.
  - **Neutral** when overlap exists but none of the above apply. Bare
    tag overlap with a contract-grade or schema-tagged node lands here:
    overlap is necessary but not sufficient for contradiction (cb:c055),
    and a shared tag alone carries no semantic contact. The entry keeps
    its `priority` marker so the candidate's grade stays visible in the
    rendered output rather than being suppressed.

  Sentiment-inversion detection (whether the proposal negates or extends
  an enum a contract closes) is deferred. Preflight relies on
  contract-grade matches with semantic contact raising adjudication
  regardless of content direction.

  ## Entry shape

      %{id: "c029", reasons: [:tag_overlap, :claim_overlap], priority: :contract_level}

  `priority` is only present when the match is contract-grade,
  regardless of which bucket the entry lands in.

  ## Example

      iex> proposed = %CB.Belief{type: "attestation", domain: "system",
      ...>   tags: ["dag-schema"], claim: "A fifth status value..."}
      iex> CB.Belief.Conflict.preflight(proposed)
      %{supportive: [...], neutral: [...], conflicting: [%{id: "c029", ...}]}
