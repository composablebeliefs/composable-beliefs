defmodule CB do
  @moduledoc """
  Composable Beliefs - root module.

  Provides `repo_root/0`, which all path computation derives from, and
  `today/0`. The framework is intentionally free of any host-application
  coupling: the only runtime dependency is Jason, and all storage routes
  through `CB.Config`.

  See `docs/guide/README.md` for the design reference; the guided tour lives
  with the teaching material in belief-collections (`../belief-collections/quickstart.md`).

  @doc """
  Returns the repository root directory.

  Resolved relative to this file (`lib/cb.ex`), so it works regardless of
  the working directory and needs no Mix at runtime.
